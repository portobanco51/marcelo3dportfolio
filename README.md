<h2 align="left">Project Overview 🔎</h2>

###

<p align="left">This SPA portfolio allows the end-user to get hands-on the production-ready product's quality, performance and glance when collaborating with me on a project 📊📈</p>

###

<p align="left">First off, this client-side was built across with mobile-first approach and SPA (Single Page Application) structure, ensuring a responsive design and cross-browser compatibility; this UI resembles the 3D experience using Three.js and React.js together, alongside Material IU for our custom reusable HOC's components 💡<br><br>For the interactivity, Rapid API GET endpoints where set up to extract projects url metadata information and provide it, accurately and updated, to the user.<br>Another service supplied to the user is the functionality to Email the web provider through a validated form, followed by a fast UI and email response, this is made posible by the POST/PUT request endpoints to Email.js database 🎯</p>

###

<p align="left">Most importantly, by having different blocks of code consuming separate API's -I built a series of services, running peer-to-peer, to fulfill my client and my client's end-users software needs- allowing scaling-up on top of the MSA (MicroServices Architectural) design 📊📈</p>

<h2 align="left">CI/CD Integration with GitHub Actions 🔄</h2>

To further enhance the project, I have integrated **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)** using **GitHub Actions**. This feature automates the deployment process, ensuring that updates are delivered efficiently and reliably.

### Benefits:
- **Faster Delivery**: Automating the deployment process reduces the time between code changes and live updates, allowing for quicker iterations and feedback.
- **Consistency**: A standardized build and deployment process minimizes the risk of human error, leading to more stable releases.
- **Scalability**: This CI/CD setup can be easily extended to include additional testing and deployment environments, supporting future growth and complexity of the project.
